0,Great. Comfortable shoes. Received them extremely fast. Have gotten compliments everywhere I go. Clark's is a great brand. Order some today.
1,"I chose this rating because this is my second pair of Bearpaws from Amazon and my first pair had a HUGE hole in the side to the point where you can see my socks, within 2 weeks of wearing them. My second pair that i just recently bought i've only worn them twice and the side is already coming apart. Horrible, never buying again for the winter."
1,Have read all books in the Michelli family series.  The books all start quick and don't stop until the last page.  I hate to put them down
0,"I don&#8217;t generally expect much from first entries in self published series. Most of them tend to be amateurish, but Ascension was a fun light read. I&#8217;m glad I came across this one and looked forward to reading the other entries in this superhero series as they become available."
0,"One mark of a good mystery is its ability to keep you guessing and then springing a surprise or two when you feel you've got things puzzled out. Ellie's search for her big sis, Nina, delivers nicely on that quality for first-time novelist Lynn Weingarten. Get ready for a thrill ride that weaves together fun, exciting, edgy, and touching with occasional flashes of sheer intensity.*No Spoilers*MY LIKES:  Smooth intros for characters that immediately spring to life. Brad was one of my favs; he's a complete riot and seems like he stepped right off a hot show on Bravo. Packed with emotion that blazes, freezes, soars, and crashes. You get to ride Ellie's emotional rollercoaster right beside her in the very front car. Nina's the missing one, but she, too, is brought vividly into key scenes via Ellie. Ah, if only all little sisters looked up to their big sis like this and under these particularly rough family circumstances.MY DISLIKES:  I'm not real crazy about writing in the present tense. Here it gets used to put you into the moment where things are happening right now, as opposed to reflections on events that already occurred. Most of those are written in past tense. The technique works, though seems like I felt the shift between the perspectives a tad more than I'd have liked. Also, the story climax comes after steadily revving up to fourth gear--awesome--but the end conclusion wrap-up seemed a bit pat to me. Again, it works though: key points and twists get stitched together. My personal tastes on all this; definitely see how you feel by the time the last page flips.THE TONE:  Starts off bouncy, bubbly. Quickly shifts into mystery gear. Road trip! Then, it's follow the leads and clues and let fate and circumstances nudge things along. Moves fast, thanks to Weingarten's sharp, crisp sentences that say just what they need to. For older readers, 9th grade and up, due to a few mature themes.A FAV LINE:  ""Just once I'd like to kiss a guy because we actually like each other, not because we've been left alone by our respective friends, who are messing around in the next room, and have run out of stuff to say, and need something else to do with our mouths."""
0,Cant use it for phones with case any case at all. hopefully u read reviews before buying it bu if u dont have a case it works as supposed to
1,"This was a cute family movie. It stars Tara Lipinski, Lindsay Felton, Jon Cryer and a young newcomer named Christopher Plumley. There is also a French actor named Olivier Galfione and a couple of funny teen-age boys named John Hooper and Jason Padgett. The movie is about the boy's homework assignment to tell the class about what he did on his summer vacation and his retelling of his adventure in Paris. He gets lost and becomes involved with some small-time crooks, eventually helping the police catch them. For a children's television movie, I must says they had some pretty spectacular locations. The story and performances are decent. The soundtrack is excellent. It is worth watching for sure."
0,A great classic song from the 80's! I feel happy when I hear this song. An excellent buy. buy now.
1,"The most practical, informative and yet reassuring book that I have read on the challenging topic of adoption.  She makes the complex topic understandable, avoids jargon, displays empathy rather than sympathy and provides facts and figures, further reading and other resources.  It is worth every penny (+ postage) that I paid for it."
0,Very durable. Clip belt is very usefull.
0,I bought this to replace an older one touch that had broken. It still makes a lot of noise but works great. My wife and I both have arthritis inn our hands and this is a lifesaver.
1,They were perfect! Shipped and received at a timely fashion. The packaging was more than satisfactory. I will purchase more products.
1,I liked this mystery.  I thought the characters were well written although the best one ended up being a victim. I didn't guess 'who-dunnit' until the end.
0,Stop fearing tax season.Use TurboTax to get the job done.Easy to use. Just follow the numbers.Answer the questions and tax preparation frustrations will cease.
1,"All I can say is that if you are looking for a CD that sounds the same the whole way through this is the one for you. The first time I tried to listen to this CD my friend and I both got migranes. I have to say I like a couple of the songs on this Cd but it's not worth buying the whole CD, just get the single."
0,The quality is really beautiful. The only dissapointment was the color. Its not fuchsia & orange its pink & orange. The color seems faded. It fits my dog perfectly & is very well made.
0,"As anyone who as read the previous volumes of Locke and key or purchased the single issues or both as I have, know what a brilliant story and amazing artwork this series gives us. This doesnt change and we only get deeper into the lives of the Locke children and the mysterious keys. What does change is Hill starts to experiment with different styles. Some might desire the same pace storytelling as in past issues however I feel it doesnt hurt the story at all. I feel anyone who has followed Locke from the start has grown with the characters and no longer needs every key explained and the plot slowed just to introduce a new key. There is much more detail and depth being developed within the characters that as readers we dont need to know where every key was found and how they figured out what each did. The real mystery especially for the children, the dark lady, the cave, and thier fathers past are being disected. This volume ends in a big way making the wait for the next vol almost unbearable. My advice is to buy the issues its a great enough series that its nice to have both. New readers start with Welcome to Lovecraft and im sure you will be hooked and on to this volume within a day as long as you can buy the volumes in between. Old readers why havent you gotten this already? It only continues an already excellent story and pushes us further and deeper into the mysteries of the Lockehouse."
1,i am used to swanson broth and didn't really think different brands would be that different. i use broth in soups mostly and the flavor of this is not far off from water. did not serve it's purpose for me.
0,Leviathan unlike the Abyss was one of numerous underwater thrillers that had good special effects but needed more work on the script. Peter Weller played a good part but should've stuck to playing Robocop and Richard Crenna who played Doc has never been the same since First Blood in 1982. But all in all A great film.
0,These double brackets worked out great theyre sturdy and look great. Theyve been up for a few weeks now and no sag or shimmy at all.
1,"Emma Styles is to be praised! She has written a shocking and graphic memoir of ""forbidden"" female lust and desire that is both highly arousing and totally unforgettable!Emma Styles has written a highly entertaining and erotic account of her insatiable sexual appetite that could only be seeded, nurtured and grown properly in authentic Parisian soil.  I would describe her as a modern day, self-assured, emancipated ""O"" and ""Emmanuelle""She has taken us deep into the depraved mind of a married woman on a journey of sexual freedom, awakening and debauchery usually ascribed only to men.Emma Styles has bravely crossed a line by sharing with us intimate details of her life few are willing to reveal and most can only fantasize about.""First Tango In Paris"" is well written and engaging. You may find yourself becoming easily swept away and completely absorbed in its  candor and revelations. Read it if you dare!"
1,I have one in our family's cars & our bags.  We also use it on our camping trips. They are also great for road trip & flying.
0,"By far the worst book Patricia Cornwell has written.  Instead of a compelling story, this one is fragmented and a real chore to read. The font is so tiny that it is hard to read.  I love all her books except this one. Her  Sarpetta series are hard to put down, this one I cant wait to put down, in fact I may not finish it."
1,STILL CANNOT BELIEVE ADAM YAUCH IS GONE SO SOON! THE MOST UNDER-RATED BAND ON THE PLANET. WHITE BOYS CAN RAP. BEST BELIEVE IT FOOLS!STUPID CANCER!!!!!
1,We used these spotlights on our  front entry door to highlight Christmas decorations...Not as bright as I would have liked but adequate and no high electric bills for December due to outdoor lighting.....
