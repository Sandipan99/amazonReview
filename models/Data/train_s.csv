0,A good modern translation of the Bible. Its style is acceptable and should appeal to readers familiar with older versions.

0,I purchased this laser site for my AR15. The first thing I noticed was it's large size and weight almost as big as a cigar. That ment double mounts twice as many to loosen up from the recoil. I was impressed with the strength of the laser and the distance. It was still visable at around 50yds on a somewhat bright day. But unfortunately after 5 30rd clips the clamps loosened up. I took it home and retightened the clamps using a dab of locktight this time. The aluminum threads were already showing the ware and getting harder to tighten. After another 150rds it fell completely off the gun and has not worked since could be the batteries but the mounts are definitely shot. I just purchased and recieved one half the size and weight for half the price. Shorter visability but still good at 25yds and short enough to even mount tightly on my Sig P250 45cal. I'll write a review on that one after I've fired a few hundred rounds.

0,"Robert Englund, a man most of us know as Freddy Kruger, directs the Horror/Comedy entitled ""Killer Pad"". Englund does an ok job having fun with the genre and the script by Dan Stoller has about one real laugh, everything else is just silly one liners and lame fart jokes that we could easily have found on Nickelodeon. There are some amusing side characters played namely by Joey Lawrence, H&eacute;ctor Jim&eacute;nez and Andy Milonakis but they aren't big enough stars to really drive the picture home. The one really humorous part in the entire movie is when Joey Lawrence does his impression of Bruce Willis, it really is almost uncanny. To get to the plot of the movie, three friends buy a huge house in the Hollywood Hill's, the only problem is the devil lives in the basement. The friends decide to throw a house warming party, but since the devil lives in the basement people at the party start dieing and things start going terribly wrong. In premise this sounds like there should be a lot of fun involved, and ""Killer Pad"" is at times a pretty amusing ride but not very much at all sticks or is worth watching again. Watching this movie again would be a fate far worse then death. This being said I did semi enjoy myself, for about five minutes, when the end credits started rolling. One aspect that really detracts from the overall enjoyment of the movie is the stupidity of the all the characters. Dan Stoller made the three main characters so stupid and idiotic that it's almost unbearable to watch. There is Boss battle against Satan at the end of the movie to the sounds of KISS but it's really anti-climactic and just frustrates me even more. I expected more from Robert Englund who is so seasoned in the genre, and although he does do an ok job of directing his actors, because the acting wasn't terrible, the question I find myself asking is why on earth Englund would have agreed to have anything to do with this movie. The real flaws are in Stoller's script, in which he keeps giving the same jokes over and over. I expected more from Daniel Franzese, who in this played Doug, one of the idiotic poorly written leads. It's sad to see Daniel Franzese in such a horribly unfunny role when we've seen him so funny as Damien in Mean Girls. The other leads, played by Eric Jungmann and Shane McRae do what they can with such a poorly written script. Aside from the horrid script the next biggest problem is this movie does not deserve its ""R"" rating. If this movie was going to get an ""R"" rating anyway I expect more nudity, blood, gore, raunchy humor, or something to hold the ""R"" rating or even my complete attention, but instead we are left with a movie that barely should have earned a ""PG-13"". Mr. Englund I'm disappointed in you."
1,"From the first time I listened to this disc, I instantly had it stuck in my head.  Their heavy drums and bass give the music a rock feel while great lyrics and a synthesizer keep things original and fun, plus their music just sounds like something the coolest person you know would listen to.Black History Month is one of the best/catchiest songs I have ever heard.  I also love sexy results, but really every track is awesome and different!"

0,"I enjoyed this book overall, especially the interplay between Ben and Vestara. However, I was very confused by the author's inability to disinguish between the Chevs and Chevins. This may seem pedantic, but the slavery issue was a major theme in the book. The author's inability to remember which species was oppressor or oppressed in the SAME paragraph was very frustrating. I know this is only the author's second venture into the SW universe, but either better research or better editting would have done wonders. That said, it was a good story on the whole; and I eagerly anticipate the next installment in the series."
1,"I don't care for musicals but this one will be a favorite of mine that I will watch time and time again.  I love the story behind it.  It does'nt matter what background we come from or what culture we are accustomed to, love and kindness for others have no boundaries."
1,"Although I've tried several times, I just cannot read this book.  Maybe it gets better if I try reading more, but I've found myself so bored that I just don't stick with reading this book beyond a few pages each try.  I'm a Christie fan and have loved her other books, but this one is so different...... the character just mopes about complaining and getting advice.  It is doubtful that I will complete this book beyond the 2 chapters I've pushed myself through."

1,"when i squeeze it out, it leaks out of the cap. Does not travel well. I like to take it with me when i go out of town but it spilled in my luggage even when i wrapped the cap shut. oh well. TSA checked it and im sure they were wondering why someone would carry soy sauce. lol. everything washed out okay. I do use it a lot but i think this will last me a year or two."
0,"We purchased this for a friend who works late and often walks home in the dark. We were quite concerned about his safety and this Silicone Lightweight Led Armband and it's certainly gotten the attention of cars when I wear them on my arms. Highly recommended safety gear, especially for the price!"
1,A fascinating view of American pioneers. My family is in this book as well. I wonder if it will be reprinted--it would be great for our children.
1,"It seems that amazon is saturated with vitamin C serum options, and although I haven't tried them all, I don't think there is any need.  This brand is completely affordable, and even produced results that I didn't expect.  I personally have &#34;problem&#34; skin, in that I break out at least once a month, in a big way.  Now, this product wasn't supposed to help that, but it did.The directions suggest using the serum morning and night on clean skin, and I did this, without using any other skin products, for the past two weeks. It feels really gentle, and smooth on your skin.  Most importantly, though, you don't feel it on your skin, since it sinks right in.  After about a week of doing this, after my shower (once my skin was moist), the top layer of my skin sloughed off when I rubbed it with my towel.  This was unexpected, but fantastic.  I really think it's the only reason why my skin hasn't been breaking out, as scheduled, for the past week.  It's like using a gentle exfoliant.My needs had nothing to do with reducing wrinkles, so I'm not sure how the product is in that regard.  But it certainly helped prevent breakouts, since it gently broke down the outer layer of my skin, to give it a more replenished look."
0,This laptop is a good laptop for gamers like myself and for business purposes. The Wireless reception on this laptop is great.I own a linksys wireless access point and the signal from the laptop is strong even if i am outside the house. The only problem i have with this laptop is that the burning the recovery cds for the laptop was not successful. The burning process failed twice for me when i attempted create backp cds. This is serious since the laptop does not come with cds but all the software is backed up on 5 gigs of your harddrive.What good is it if it cant be burn on to DVDs. But other than that the laptop is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!PS. Sony's tech support is excellent
0,Not only a great travel show but a fantastic host. The host is absolutely a delight. She makes you want to buy the rest of her travel channel shows. Great job.
0,"This book should really be viewed as a study bible for the New Testament without the bible part! It contains sections on the authorship, setting, purpose and outline of each book in the New Testament. The treatments given are extensive; there is also a section that harmonizes the Gospels. The outlines are detailed and there is typically 5-10 lines of commentary for every chapter.The book is fairly even handed in the treatment it gives of the various conservative opinions on controversial subjects (such as the dating of the Gospels). The more liberal opinions are mentioned but not usually taken seriously. Having discussed the various options the author usually lands on the 'standard' conservative view.In short this book does not really break any new ground; and it isn't trying to. It is a useful compendium of 'standard' opinion. I would certainly recommend it for anyone that doesn't have a good study bible or for anyone with the interest to sit down and read cover to cover.It can and is used for a number of degree level courses although frankly I don't think it contains anything that would prove difficult for the casual but interested reader."
1,"While this book is a light read, I found it to fall very short in being entertaining. First of all, it was unbelievable.  Secondly, the author's jokes just aren't funny.  He's trying to be clever, but fails.  Third, I never truly believed the characters were in love.  The characters have no backbone.  A very disappointing read and I would not recommend."
0,"This book picks up where the first book, &#34;The Language Construction Guide&#34; left off giving you a more indepth look at language and how to use that language in your own creations."
1,The rating for this book is so fitting. I couldn't put this book down and was mad when I had to go to work because I wanted to know how it ended. I know I'll be getting the next book in the series!
0,nice but dont let them stay wet or they will rust.  some 0000 steel wool cleans them up but for the price i can't really complain.  the block is nice.  in the future i think i will spend the extra money to get a proper stainless set.
0,This review is for both Season 3 & The DVDShowTime does it again. The Tudors is one of the very few cable only TV shows worth watching and the acting is very well done. This DVD set includes the full 3rd season & leaves you wanting Season 4.
1,The movie is great. I love it and think more people would if it was shown.
0,"I got this shoe to replace another manly shoe, but it turns out this new Caterpillar shoe is even more manly a shoe than my last, which worked out great because my feet are also manly, being attached to the legs of a man.  So I wear the to work, I've worn them on impromptu hikes in the mud, and I can run and jump in them.  They are always comfortable and easy to put on, and haven't worn out a jot.However, bad on ice!  They skate better than skates, except they insist upon throwing you to the ground.  I have a large scar on my arm and a still swollen calf because the second these touch ice, they send you flying!  And no I did not see the ice coming, but this shoe was not at all forgiving about that either.So stay off the ice in these and they'll be your best friend."
1,"This is a product my family bought for years and worked.  When not able to purchase in the drug stores around here, I decided to try Amazon.com.  Yay!  I ordered it and they were to ship it to me quick.  I paid the quickest shiping available.  First of all, the product ordered and the product that I received was not the same.  I ordered CHEWABLE.  These were tablets.  In summary, not the right product and it took almost two weeks for it to come.  I spent over thirty-five dollars.  Thats enough to correct the problem right there."
0,"If you've seen the film, you'll know how wonderfully wacky and off-beat it is. This album follows the same direction....from mainstream pop songs like Rhythm Of The Night to the excellent version of Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend, this album is a great way to re-live the magic of the movie. Of course, the biggest drawcard is the chance to hear Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sing, and they measure up very nicely. Their vocal talents are showcased on several tracks, but the highlight would have to be Elephant Love Medley - a collage of many love songs, where Nicole and Ewan really shine in their vocal abilities. Another standout track is Diamonds Are A girls Best Friend, with Nicole in lead vocals. This would have be the best version of this song - a throughly modern version of a wonderful classic. A slight disappointment is the exclusion of 'Like A virgin' - if you've seen the movie, you would know how hilarious this version is. Do yourself a favour - go and see the movie and buy this CD!"
1,"I love these bags. As another reviewer shared, I too raise labs for Guide Dogs for the Blind and these bags are perfect. I had tried several brands of bags before I stumbled upon these. They are very easy to tear off the roll and open. Not too thin. I have never had one break on me. I like the fact that they are green and not so see-through. Plenty big enough.  And of course, they are biodegradable. All in all, a great find! These bags last us about two and a half months with our one Lab puppy."

1,"This book is just so horrible, I wanted to return it after I read about 30 pages. I do not know who the author is, but it sounds to me like the book is written by a gay men, who just wrote about his gay friends, changed Scott, Chris and Bill to Cheryl Gina and Linda and thought he had a book about women. Obviously, the author wants to cash in on the recent popularity of books about young, single women, but the women in his book are devoid of any sensitivity or charm. I was not convinced that they were looking for anything else but meaningless sex, they do not seem capable of any deeper feelings. And when they do have their meaningless sex, they do not even have any fun, because they either do it with fat obnoxious guys or they just go down on a guy. Hello???? No wonder they are all miserable and on antidepressants; they are not getting any but they are surely putting out a lot. Plus they all seemed so annoying, self-absorbed, vindictive and petty that I was just hoping that they would all get herpes and their contrive adventures would come to a swift end. You may wonder why I bothered to finish the book, I wonder myself."
0,"I became acquainted with the murder of William Desmond Taylor in the 70s after reading Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon. I was in Hollywood in those days to be an actor and was struggling to survive in a tawdry world whose glitter days had long since past.The unsolved aspect of this particular case made it all the more intriguing. I tracked down nearly all the addresses extant then. I started with his mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and tracked down many of his addresses, including the bungalow, which still existed at that time.I've read many other accounts of the WDT murder, this being probably the best. Robert Giroux tells a very plausible tale of Old Hollywood befitting a career as a journalist. The photographs alone are some of the best I've seen and well worth the price of the book. They are some the best I've ever seen in any book on Hollywood from this era.William Desmond Taylor's murder occurred more than ninety years ago. The fact that people today, who weren't even born yet, read about it, debate and discuss it, speaks to the iconic nature of the crime, it's aftermath and the fallout which prevailed in the motion picture industry for nearly half a century afterward.We will never know for certain ""whodunit"". But this very well researched and well written offers a theory as plausible as any. By reading you may find yourself escaping into a world of yesterday, long gone but hopefully never forgotten.It's a good read."
0,"This film is undoubtedly one of my favourite films of all time. Having viewed this film countless times, I thought it necessary to make a comment given the negative opinions expressed by some people.What with the brilliant acting, witty and clever dialogue, intriguing plot and magnificant musical score it's hard to fathom how someone could dislike this film. At the heart of the film's brilliance is its open-ended plot. Unlike Memento and 12 Monkeys (and Mulholland Drive to a degree), the viewer is required to form his own conclusions as to the ultimate meaning the film imparts. It requires the viewer to think; it is indie at its absolute best.It is not a mainstream film in any sense of the word. And it is, as others have said, a film that you will either love or hate. If you generally like films that have a discernable plot and comprehensible conclusion it is likely that you will dislike this film.But with an open mind, multiple viewings and patience (of which some people obviously lack), you too shall fall in love with this film. It is, quite simply, brilliant."

For whatever reason the help documentation doesn't work well so I use the web. Out of the box this WON't work with Mavericks but an update from the App Store solves the remaining issues
0,"Like most other people have said, you have to order several sizes down to get something that may actually fit. I ordered the smallest size in stock, which was at least a size smaller than my feet actually are, and it was still too big. The slippers felt cheap and uncomfortable, too."
0,"I'm usually afraid to try products like this because they tend to weigh my hair down. I didn't find this with this product, in fact, it rinsed clean and made my hair feel 'stronger' if that makes sense. I felt less split ends and dryness. It recommends using it twice a week, but I found once a week sufficient."
0,"American Standard is truly a top of the line spout. Chrome finish is mirror like, no flaws and best of all is the functionality. Could not believe how smooth;y it changes to shower mode with a perfect seal, absolutely no dripping. Price at Amazon for American Standard high quality spout is similar to local H.Depot's price for a low quality ""generic"" replacement, made in China. Hands down Amazon wins."
1,She is one of my favorite author's. the book came in perfect condition and i am completely happy with it.
0,"It's been a number of years since I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but I nevertheless was looking forward to seeing the movie version of Douglas Adams' story. Hitchhiker's has had a storied past: first a radio play, then a book, then a TV series, and now, finally after much effort, a film. None of the stories completely line up with each other, though all the major elements are present...""lining up"" was never the point of all this.The introductory part of the story is pretty easy to understand. Arthur Dent, an Englishman, is saved from the destruction of the Earth by his close friend Ford Prefect, who is not human, it turns out, but is an alien researcher for the best-selling book ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". What ensues is a series of misadventures, as the pair encounter the President of the Galaxy (who's on the run), and an old flame of Arthur's, and a depressed robot. The President has stolen a newfangled spaceship, and is in search of the Ultimate Question.This story has always been about fun. The movie carries it off perfectly, with a lot of small and large humorous moments. Two stand-out for me: the opening number, song by the dolphins, is great, as is the scene where the ship pops out of improbability space temporarily in the form of a ball of yarn, and Arthur, in yarn form, starts vomiting yarn.I heard that this movie was done ""on the cheap"", relative to other special effects blockbusters. It doesn't show at all. The planetary construction yard, towards the end of the movie, is pretty awe-inspiring.The actors do a fine job, doing justice to the material. No one will win awards for their work here...the point of the movie is the small humorous parts, not deep character development.So, I definitely recommend this movie, for all ages. I expect I'll be owning this on DVD, when it becomes available."

1,"I'm not going to provide an analysis of this novel; that's already been done well by several other Amazon customers, as well as by book reviewers around the world. All I have to say is that I'd always meant to read it but somehow never had to in school. It's the first Kindle e-book that I downloaded when I got my iPad. I read it over the span of about 3 days and can't say enough great things about it.Steinbeck's tale is still frighteningly relevant today, a time where they'll slash the jobs of thousands of factory workers so that top executives can get raises. The scorn and contempt that average citizens express for the ""Okies"" in this story is eerily reminiscent of the attitudes that many of today's more fortunate people have toward those who are forced to collect unemployment for years on end, or else settle for minimum-wage jobs that don't even come close to supporting a family.I'm so impressed by this book that I'm going to get my hands on as much Steinbeck work as possible."
